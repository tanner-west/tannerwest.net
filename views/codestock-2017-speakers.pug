        p#first I'm excited to be attending my first developers' conference, <a href="http://codestock.org/" title="CodeStock">CodeStock 2017</a>, in May. To make sure I get the most of my time there, I've been reading up on all the speakers and their topics to get a feel for which talks I'd like to attend. In the process I've compiled a list all the speakers and their talks, which you can see below. Clicking on each speaker's name will take you to his or her Twitter or website.
        p You can view the JSON data for this list on this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tanner-west/d86b10aad989bd9a436cdcb6c3bb3a2e" title="CodeStock 2017 Speakers">GitHub Gist</a>. I'm having trouble finding URLs for a few of the speakers. If you have any of the missing information, or if you find an error, please let me know. 

        -for (var j = 0; j < speakerList.length; j++)
          -if (j == 0 || j % 3 == 0)
            .row
              -for (var i = j; i < (3 + j); i++ )
